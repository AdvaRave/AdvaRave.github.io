                           Did the alert happen in the same time with other alerts? Do the same type of alerts happen over and over again?<br/>
                           Also, in order to prevent an overloaded screen, we aggregated the alerts by category and mentioned the type of the critical alerts in each category (which is very important to the user).<br/><br/>
